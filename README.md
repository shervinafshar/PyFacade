PyFacade
--------

A simple framebuffer implementation in Python for controlling Ars Electronica LED media facade.

This library of functionalities was used for realization of the project ["Linz Bunt Blitz: A Zeitgeist in RGB"](http://www.shervinafshar.name/wiki/Linz_Bunt_Blitz).

Here is a video recording of the opening night: http://vimeo.com/14809768

A [similar yet more advanced library](https://github.com/danomatika/rc-facade) by Dan Wilcox was my reference implementation while developing this set of functionalities.
